# Drone Delivery System

Recently the geeks at Amazon turn up with the cool idea to use drones to deliver goods right in front of your front door. Nice idea! However it may be not so simple to implement.

We are going to design and implement a system controlling and scheduling deliveries with drones.

## Our city

For the sake of simplicity our city will be a 1000x1000 square matrix. Our drones will fly around it and deliver the goods.

## Drones

* Each drone has a:
  * unique id - we should have a way to distinguish them
  * battery - unfortunately they cannot run forever but will usually last a flight to the end of the city and back, then they must recharge. We will measure them with BU (battery units).
  * capacity - they cannot take infinitely many products as well. We will measure their capacity with WU (weight units)
  * charging rate - measured in BU per minutes

## Products

* Each product has a:
  * name (e.g. keyboard)
  * weight per quanitity (0.5 kg for 1 keyboard)

## Warehouse

At the warehouse we will store the goods that should be delivered.

* Each warehouse has a:
	* coordinates - the place in our city
	* information about the available products - we should keep track of the quiantities we have of a given product.

## Requests

Lets suppose that we will receive the requests from console as a simple text.

We will support the following requests:

### Delivery request

It will look like this:

delivery (id) (timestamp) (target coordinates) (product name 1) (quantity) (product name 2) (quantity) ...

### Supply request

It will look like this:

supply (id) (timestamp) (product name 1) (product weight) (quantity) (product name 2) (product weight) (quantity)

## How deliveries are made

* When we receive a supply request we will simply update our information at the warehouse and log a message about the supply.

* When we receive a delivery request we will try to execute it. If we can execute the delivery request we should log a message containing the ETA (estimated time of arrival). If we cannot process the current request now we should log a message with the reason why we cannot process the task.


### Executing

If we have the needed amount of each product for a given delivery task we should be able to process it. If the WU (weight capacity) of one drone is not enough for processing the delivery we should use as much drones as we need.

If we do not have the needed amount of at least one product we should log an error message.
Bonus points if we execute it later (after a supply)

### Estimating ETA

Each drone needs a minute for each DU (distance unit) travelled and will use 1 BU (battery unit) for each DU.

The DUs are calculated as follows: The distance from cell [x1, y1] to cell [x2, y2] is calculated as ((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)^-2 (two-dimensional Euclidean distance).

Moreover the drone needs a minute for each different product to load and a minute for each different product to unload at the target location. No BUs are used during loading/unloading.

The batteries of the drones can be charged only at the warehouse.
Take this in consideration when calculating the ETA.

The ETA is the time that the last drone has unloaded the goods at the location.

## Drone Delivery System v1

For our first version of the delivery system:

* All drones will have:
  * 2 000 BU
  * 5 BU/min charging rate
  * 500 WU capacity

* The warehouse is at coordinates [42, 42]

## Drone Delivery System v2

Thanks to the great first version of the Delivery System, our delivery business has expnaded ! Now more companies are using our drones for their delivery requests.

In fact so much that we have to proccess many requests simultaneously (yup, this means concurrently). We will receive this requests as multiple files.

In order to keep up with the new loads we have bought 30 more drones:
	
* Our new chinese drones have:
  * 1 200 BU
  * 3 BU/min charging rate
  * 200 WU capacity
