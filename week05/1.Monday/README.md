## Vector
We can represent a 2D vector with two values: [x1, x2]. 3D vectors can be represented by [x1, x2, x3]. n-dimensional vectors are represented by [x1, x2, x3, ..., xn]. (Obviously, 2D and 3D vectors are n-dimensional vectors, where n is 2 and 3, respectively)

In this task you will create a Vector class for n-dimensional vectors.

* Create a constructor that takes a variable number of arguments - the coordinates
* Create a constructor that copies an existing vector
* Think of a way to get and set each coordinate of the vector
* Create a method for returning the dimensionality of the vector (E.g. for a 3D vector it should return 3)
* Create a method for returning the length of the vector
* Override `toString()`
* Override `equals()`
* Override `hashCode()`
* define methods `add(Vector vector)`, `subtract(Vector vector` between vectors (First check if the 2 vectors have the same dimension! If they don't, print a message that they cannot be added.)
* define methods `add(float by)`, `subtract(flaot by)`, `multiply(float by)`, `divide(float by)` between a vector and a scalar
* define `dotProduct(Vector vector)` - the dot product of 2 vectors (First check if the 2 vectors have the same dimension!)

## VAT TAX calculator

You need to create a VAT tax calculator.
The calculator must calculate a product's price VAT tax based on a country.
The list with countries with the corresponding taxes must be passed to the calculator when it is initialized.
One of the countries must be the default country.
The calculator should return the additional tax on a specific product price based on its country.
If the country isn't specified then the default country must be used instead.

The following classes and method must be implemented:

* CountryVatTax class which contains the following properties : countryId, VATTax, IsDefault.
Note : the class must be immutable
* VAT tax calculator class that implementes a default contrustror which accept a list of CountryVatTax
* VAT tax calculator class must implements a method CalculateTax which should calculate VAT tax on a product price
* CalculateTax() method should accept product price and countryId (countryId isn't mandatory so an overload method should be implemented which doesn't accept countryId. In that case the default country tax must be used for calculations)
* If country isn't supported then an appropriate NotSupportedCountryException should be thrown.

## Shop Inventory

Create an ShopInventory class which contains all products available in an inventory:

* Every product must keep information about the product's price (before and after taxes), in which country the product could be bought(only one country) and the name of the product, product's quantity, product's id (integer).
* The price with the taxes must be calculated with the help of the VAT Tax calculator.
* The inventory must keep all available products (they should be passed to the constructor of the class).
* The inventory should have a method called Audit which should tell the user how much money will be earned if all products are sold out
* Implement class order which contains information about a particular order (product's ids that must be bought + their quantity)
* The Inventory class must implements a method RequestOrder. It should get an order and calculates its amount. If the inventory doesn't contain all the required products then a specific exception must be thrown - NotAvailableInInventoryException.

## Bouncing balls game (a long term task)

Create a class Ball that has the following information:

* Diameter of the ball
* Position of the center of the ball
* Color of the ball
* Direction of movement
* Speed of movement (constant)
* Method move() which moves the ball 1 frame in its current direction with its current speed (the move method makes just 1 step)
* Color, diameter, direction and speed can be changed at any time

Create a class Game that hold a list of balls and moves them inside a specified rectangle.

* Create a constructor of the Game class which takes width and height as arguments - 
the game rectangle will be (0,0,width,height)
* Expose the list of balls as a property so that balls can be added later
* Create a moveAll method which moves all the balls in the game (calls their move method)
  * If a ball reaches an edge of the game rectangle, it should bounce of it (change its direction)
  
Create a class Player which represents a small moving rectangle which moves at the bottom edge of the game area
* The player has a x-axis position and can either move left or right at a fixed speed
* The player can also shoot with a laser upwards - the laser represents a single line which starts from the center
of the top edge of the player and goes up to the top edge of the game area. If it intersects any ball, the ball
is split into two smaller balls, each with a diameter equal to half the diameter of the hit ball, rounded down to
the nearest integer. If the new diameter is smaller than a given constant MIN_DIAMETER, then these balls are just removed

Create a user interface where the game is actually playable. Use the bare-bone project from the github repository.

The game should be something similar to this old Nintendo classic [Buster Bros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulfIohdFv08)
