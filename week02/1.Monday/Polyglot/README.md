I will provide guides for compiling too.When you are ready, you can provide me with the answer from the code.
And I will reveal a secret to you!
Type help, to get you started.
Enter command>

```

Now you can enter different commands in order to start the task:

* `help` command will list you everything
* `list` command will give you all languages and their status
* `start <number>` will create a new folder with the given language. It is time to solve the language puzzle! (Ctrl-C to exit `polyglot.py`)
