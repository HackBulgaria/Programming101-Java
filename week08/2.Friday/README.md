## Welcome to the mystic world of multithreading

### 1. Make a simple Thread class that prints a message.

### 2. Make a simple Runnable class that prints a message.

### 2. Use one of the previously implemented classes and now print something from the main thread.
Now try using .joint() before printing the message from the main class.

### 3. Make Thread that sums two integers provided from the user.

### 4. Lost update example. Make two threads that increment the same counter 1 000 000 times. What is the result? Why this problem exists? How can we resolve it? 
Hint: synchronized, atomic classes

### 5. Try to reproduce Visibility problem.
