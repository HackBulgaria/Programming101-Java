# Peer Review

Your task for today is not about writing code. It is about looking at code & improving it.

Using the knowledge we have from [the prereading](../prereading.md), do the following:

1. Split into groups of 2.
2. Both of you - pick a problem of your choice.
3. Conduct a peer review. Lets say we have two peers `A` and `B`.
  * `A` should look, comment & suggest improvements for `B`'s code.
  * `B` should do the same for A's code.
4. Whenever there are suggestions for improvements, make a pull request. (This means, that `A` should fork `B`'s code repo and vice versa)

We are going to make 5 rotations with different groups.

Peer reviews are essential for learning!
