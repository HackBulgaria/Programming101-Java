##Start Here!##

Welcome :) 

Here are a few things you should probably get done before the start of the Programming 101 - java course:

**1)** Install JDK 8 ( Java SE Development Kit ) from [oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)- we will work with it. You can follow [this guide](http://askubuntu.com/a/55960).

**2)** Make sure java binaries are registered in PATH
and that they are **the same version**

```
java -version

java version "1.8.0_65"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_65-b17)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.65-b01, mixed mode)
```
```
javac -version
javac 1.8.0_65
```

**3)** Install Eclipse Mars from [Eclipse site]
(https://eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/mars/1/eclipse-java-mars-1-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz&mirror_id=1190)

or use the [installer](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

**4)** Read the [Google style-guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html) for Java source code:

We will be using very similiar style guide, but with the following modifications:
- 4 spaces for identation instead of 2.
- 120 lines for line-wrapping instead of 80.

**5)** Create yourself a GitHub account!
If you have never worked with git or GitHub, see the [excellent article](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101/tree/master/week1/git.md) from
HackBulgaria's programming 101 course:

## Installing Linux

We suggest using the Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) version: [14.04.03]
(http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

Before moving on and installing any Linux, **PLEASE BACKUP EVERYTHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU**.

Don't leave memories only on the hard drive of your PC / laptop. It will eventually fail and you will eventually lose everything that is not backed up.

Our suggestion is, use one or more of the following:

* [pcloud](https://www.pcloud.com/)
* [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
* Other similar cloud services
