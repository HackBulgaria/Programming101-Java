# Tasks


## Binary Search
Implement a binary search function.
It should receive a list of elements that implement the comparable interface.
It should return a true if the element is contained, false otherwise.


## Implement Counting sort

Create a counting sort function.
It should receive a List of Integers.
It should return a new List containing the same integers but sorted in descending order.


## Implement Merge sort

Implement the merge sort algorithm.
It should receive an array/list of Integers.
It should rearrange the input numbers.


## Improve your algorithm

Improve your sorting algorithm.

It may be good idea if the number of input elements are less than 32 for example to use other sorting algorithm. Use bubble sort or insertion sort for example.

It may also be good idea to use bubble sort or insertion sort for example when the merge sort tries to sort parts of the array that are smallar than 32.


## Lets use Generics again

Now when you have ultra-mega-giga cool sorting function you want to use it on not just numbers, but anything that is comparable.

Rewrite your sorting function so that it uses generics.
