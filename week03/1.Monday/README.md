# Generic Problems

## 1.Generic backpack

You need a digital backback. Make a simple class that takes a single object of any type. The class should use generics. Make getters and setters for the field.

## 2.Pair

In Java you are limited to return only one object from a method. In same cases this could be an inconvenience. One workaround is to make a class that holds two objects, so you can have multiple returned objects.

Make the class pair from the last week generic. It should hold two objects from arbitrary type. Make getters and setters.

## 3.Triple

Well, you may also need to return 3 objects from a function. Make a class named Triple that holds ... well three object of arbitrary type. Make getters and setters.

## 4.Sumation function

Make function that sums two numbers. It should be able to sum every type of number Byte, Int, Long, Float, Double, BigInt.

Hint: there may be something in common in all this classes, actually you should already know if you have read the prereadings. :)

## 5.Subtraction function

Make function that subtracts two numbers. It should be able to subtract every type of number Byte, Int, Long, Float, Double, BigInt.

## 6.Multiplication function

The same as the previous, but it should multiplicate two numbers.

## 7.Division function

It should multiply two numbers.

## 8.Power function

It should rise a number to a given power. Let the exponent (the power number) be a whole positive number.

Bonus: you can try to make it with negative and floating exponent.

## 9.Factorial function

Once again the lovely factorial, this time make it work for any type of number.

## 10.Make it more generic

* Remember the stack from the last week? Make it generic.
* Remember the palindrom functions from the first week? Make a generic one. Think if you can define a universal palindrome function.
* A long long time ago in a galaxy far away (Mladost 3, Resen str, 16.11.2015) you have implemented a function that finds the minimum element of an array. Guess what... you should make it generic. Let the force be with you.

The force: Think on which classes we can find the minimum.

## 11. Yet another vector.

Implement the vector Abstract Data type. It should be resize-able and have all neccessary methods. Hey It should be generic.
