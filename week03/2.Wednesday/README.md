# Collecitons Problems

## 1.Check if an expression of brackets is correct

Such expression is a string like `"()()())))((())("` - it has multiple brackets, your job is to check whether the expression is correct.
Such expression is correct if:
- it starts with a `'('`
- it ends with a `')'`
- the number of opening brackets equals exactly the number of closing brackets
- at no point in the string the number of closing brackets is higher than the number of opening brackets. E.g. `())(()` is not a valid one, because at index 2 there is a second closing bracket with only one opening bracket.


## 2.Reverse a generic collection
Declare a method, expecting a Collection and reverse it in your method. Return the same collection given, do not return a new collection!.

```java
static <T> void  reverse (Collection<T> collection)`
```

*Do not try to use* Collections.reverse. It works only for a List, and not for collections : )


## 3.Implement an on/off collection
Implement a Collection, in which, if you add an element twice, the element gets removed from your collection.

*Hint and edge case spoiler:* How would you handle null objects? :)
*Fun fact:*: As logical idea behind a collection is an abstraction of a... well, bunch of elements, allowing null sometimes makes no sense.


## 4.Rotate the elements of a collection
Make a void *utility* method that rotates the contents of a collection.

You are given a collection containing `[one, two, three, four, five, six, seven]`
"Rotating" it once means the collection becoming `[seven, one, two, three, four, five, six]`

```java
void rotate(Collection<T> collection, int rotateStep )
```

`rotateStep` can be negative - meaning you are rotating to the left, and not to the right.


## 5.Given a list contaning some duplicate values, find the first unique element
Make a *utility* method, which returns the first unique element in a given argument of type `Collection<T>`.
Example:

```java
Collection<T> ints = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,5,4,3,1);
System.out.println(yourMethod(ints)) //2;
```


## 6.Given several sets, find the duplicating elements
Write a *utility* method, that takes several sets, and returns a set that contains the duplicating elements of all the other sets.

```
A = {1,2,3,4,5}
B = {4,5,6}
C = {5,6,7,8}
```

`yourMethd(A,B,C) => D{5}`

## 7.Give me the median, quick!
Make an interface `Statistics`, which has these operations:

```
-getMean();
-getMedian();
-getMode();
-getRange();
```

If you don't know what Mean,Median, Mode and Range are, see http://www.purplemath.com/modules/meanmode.htm

Make an implementation of this interface, with an additional operation `add(int number)` (Work with integers only).

So, as a client of your code, I will be adding some integers(just like in a list), and would want you to give me the mean, median, mode and range.

*Bonus/Challenge*
Every method from `Statistics` interface should complete in O(1) time.
This is a little bit on the algorithm side, and you might need some interesting data structures : )
Come back to this when you are done with all the tasks.


## 8.Make a utility method that converts a hashMap into a very human-readable string###
Make a *utility* method that takes a `HashMap<? extends Object, ? extends Object>`
and *returns a String*, representing the HashMap.

I want you to make a utility method that does this, *do not* override `toString()` in hashMap.

Example:

```java
String result = YourUtilsClass.yourUtilMethod(map);
System.out.println(result) // { key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3 }
```

## 9.Count occurences of words in text
Make a *utility* method that takes a `String text`  and returns a map, which on every word in `text` maps the number of times this word has been used.

See Example:

```java
Map<String, Integer> result = YourUtilsClass.yourSecondUtilMethod("Ninjas are all over the place! We are all going to die!");
System.out.println(YourUtilsClass.yourFirstUtilMethod(result));
```

Outputs:

```
// { Ninjas:1, are:2, all:2, over:1, the:1, place!:1, We:1, going:1, to:1, die!:1 }
```

Retain the ordering of the elements!

##Epic bonus!##
###Cryptoanalysis fun###
There is an old technique for encrypting messages - shuffling the letters. For instance, if we take the string `Godzilla`, one crypted version of it 
is `Mrezotti`.
The cipher here is
```
G=m
o=r
d=e
i=o
l=t
z=z
```

Your task here is to decrypth the following text:
```

Once more, your task is not to make a program that *deciphers every possible text on the planet*, you just have to decipher *this text*. And by decipher, I mean extract the meaning of it - let's not care about missed dots, commas, word casing and such stuff.

####Instructions and hints####

A usually good counter-attacking technique is to simply make a histogram of the usage of letters in the *given* text and comapre it to the histogram of letters *in the language*. 
For example, in the english language, the letter 'e' is the most frequently used, in a total of 13% of all letters. So there is a good chance the most commonly used letter in the given text  is 'e'.  

You can see some frequencies and letter distribution facts here:  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency  
http://www.cryptograms.org/letter-frequencies.php  


Some hints:
- Ignore one-letter words. They are likely dots or hyphens or commas, you will add them later.
- Trim spaces on words after you parse them. Make sure you are not analysing empty spaces.
- Watch out for letter casing! Make sure you analyze uppercase 'T' the same as downcase 't'.
- Make a method `String applyCipher(Map<Character, Character> cipher)`. You will likely find a good use for it. Of course, it is not mandatory.
- As this problem requires some visual examination, do *not try* to solve in TDD at first. In fact, in general, apply *TDD* only when you have something to test for.
- If frequency attack turns out to be not good enough, check [the list of 5000 most used words in English](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LuHWIlshSqwfr3AKwvqIoXAGZrNmsPUopwfhc3DhtS4/edit#gid=0). There is a good chance some of those will be from the first words you unveil!
