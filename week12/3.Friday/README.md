Design and implement a database of tests which have questions with answers. Your app should generate you a test which chooses 10
questions, for each question chooses 3 wrong and 1 correct answer and leave you to fill it. After you complete it - it tells you
the result you have and saves it in scoreboard. Fill your DB with at least 15 questions which has more than 4 wrong and 2 correct
answers. You program can be a command line tool taking your input, generate you test, giving you ability to fill it, then tells
your result, saves it in the DB and you can see a scoreboard.
